                <p class="project-description">
                    Early diagnosis of plant diseases allows preventative measures to reduce economic and production
                    damage. Traditional methods are limited by available expertise. Plant surveillance by farmers is not
                    always practical or cost-effective.

                    Evaluate different databases and implement various neural network architectures for classifying
                    plant diseases.

                    As with every AI project, data preprocessing had to be performed to normalize the image data for
                    training the models. However, the main experiment performed was on the model architecture. There
                    were 5 different CNN models tested:

                    This is a confusion matrix of the classification for the validation data. This tests how effective
                    the model was at classifying each case. The results suggested an improvement. By separating the
                    classification into the different types of plants, the performance could be improved. The model
                    could be having to learn too many features. So one solution could be creating a series of small
                    models for classifying each disease based on plant type. THe plant type would already be known by
                    farmers, as crops are planted deliberately. Most of the functionality of a system like this would be
                    to check for diseases on a known crop. Th other improvement would be to implement a more complicated
                    model, like ResNet-18. This could recognize enough features to be effective.
